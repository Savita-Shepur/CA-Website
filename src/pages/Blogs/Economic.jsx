            <h1>Introduction: Understanding Economic Offences</h1>
            <p>
              Economic offences are a class of non-violent crimes that cause
              significant financial harm to individuals, businesses, and the
              economy at large. These offences encompass a wide range of illegal
              activities, including fraud, embezzlement, money laundering, and
              tax evasion. The impact of economic offences extends far beyond
              immediate financial losses, often eroding public trust in
              financial institutions and hindering economic growth.
            </p>
