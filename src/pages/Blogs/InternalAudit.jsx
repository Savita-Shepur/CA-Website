          <h1>Introduction to Internal Audit</h1>
          <p>
            Internal auditing is a vital function within organizations that
            provides independent assurance and consulting services. The internal
            audit definition, as per the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA),
            states that it is "an independent, objective assurance and
            consulting activity designed to add value and improve an
            organization's operations."
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Income tax meaning:</span>It's a mandatory contribution to
            state revenue, calculated as a percentage of an individual's or
            entity's income.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>What is internal audit?</span> Its purpose and objectives are
            to enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based
            and objective assurance, advice, and insight. Internal audit
            applicability extends across various types of organizations, from
            small businesses to large corporations, non-profits, and government
            entities.
          </p>

          <h1>Internal Audit Framework</h1>
          <p>
            The internal audit framework is built upon internationally
            recognized standards and guidelines, primarily those set by the IIA.
            These standards ensure consistency and quality in internal audit
            practices worldwide. Internal audit applicability also includes
            regulatory requirements, which vary depending on the industry and
            jurisdiction. For instance, publicly traded companies in the United
            States must comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which mandates
            specific internal control requirements.
          </p>

          <p>
            Within the corporate governance structure, internal audit plays a
            crucial role in providing assurance to the board of directors and
            senior management about the effectiveness of risk management,
            control, and governance processes.
          </p>

          <h1>Types of Internal Audits</h1>
          <p>
            There are several types of internal audits, each focusing on
