              Mastering Fixed Deposits: The Ultimate Guide to Secure Investments
            </h1>

            <h1>Introduction: Understanding Fixed Deposits</h1>
            <p>
              Fixed deposits (FDs) are a cornerstone of personal finance in
              India, offering a secure way to grow your savings. The fixed
              deposit meaning is simple: it's an investment where you deposit a
              lump sum for a fixed period at a predetermined interest rate. This
              stability makes FDs an essential part of many investors'
              portfolios, especially those seeking low-risk options.
            </p>

            <h1>Types of Fixed Deposits</h1>
            <p>
              There are several types of fixed deposits to suit different

            <h1>Using Fixed Deposits as Collateral for Loans</h1>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Overdraft against fixed deposits: Typically up to 90% of FD
                  value

              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              This feature provides liquidity without breaking the FD
              prematurely.
            </p>

            <h1>Fixed Deposits vs. Other Investment Options</h1>
            <p>Comparing FDs with other investments:</p>
            <div className="unordered1">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  FDs vs. Mutual Funds: FDs offer guaranteed returns but
                  potentially lower growth
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fixed deposits vs. savings accounts: FDs offer higher interest
                  but less liquidity
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              Cons of FDs: Lower returns compared to market-linked investments,
              less liquidity
            </p>
            <p>
              Understanding these comparisons helps in creating a balanced
              investment portfolio.
