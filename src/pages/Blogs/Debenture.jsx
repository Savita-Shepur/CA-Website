    <h1>Introduction: What are Debentures?</h1>
    <p>In the world of corporate finance, debentures play a crucial role in raising capital for businesses. But what exactly are debentures? The debentures definition encompasses a type of debt instrument used by companies to borrow money from investors. Understanding the debentures meaning in finance is essential for both companies seeking to raise funds and investors looking for investment opportunities.</p>
    <p>Debentures are essentially long-term debt securities issued by a company, promising to pay the holder a fixed rate of interest and to repay the principal amount on a specified date. Unlike shares, debentures do not confer ownership rights in the company. Instead, debenture holders are creditors of the company.</p>
