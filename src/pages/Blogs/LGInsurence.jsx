          <h1>Introduction: What is Insurance?</h1>
          <p>
            Insurance is a financial tool designed to protect individuals and
            businesses from unexpected losses. The insurance meaning, at its
            core, is a contract between the insured and the insurer, where the
            insurer agrees to compensate the insured for specific future losses
            in exchange for regular premium payments. This concept forms the
            foundation of financial planning, providing a safety net against
            life's uncertainties.
