            <h1>Cyber Crime and Financial Fraud: A Dangerous Duo</h1>
            <p>
              The intersection of cybercrime and financial fraud has created a
              particularly dangerous landscape for consumers and businesses
              alike. Cybercriminals exploit financial systems through various
              means:
            </p>
            <div className="unordered1">

            <p>
              A notable case study is the 2018 Cosmos Bank cyber heist, where
              hackers stole ₹94 crore through a sophisticated malware attack on
              the bank's ATM server.

            <div className="unordered1">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Indian Penal Code (IPC) contains several sections dealing
                  with fraud, including Section 420 for cheating and dishonestly
                  inducing delivery of property.
